  <p>Being a human on this spinning rock I most enjoy being creative and laughing with my wonderful wife and family... a lot of laughing! I'm so grateful for every day we all have and am dedicated to making life a journey filled with fun, imaginative energy for all we have to experience here together. My imagination is the most important thing in my personal and professional life because it allows me to see all of life as new creations.</p>
