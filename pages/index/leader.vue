  <p>I like to lead with inspiration because I believe true leadership is transferredâ€”passion to inspire another I've found is incredibly powerful. Just aspiring to be a great leader is not leadership, embracing change no matter how hard and always doing the right thing, is. Imagination for what is to come against what has become is what leads me personally into new light and inspiration so that's what I try to cultivate inside others.</p>
