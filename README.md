## My Personal Webpage

This is home for my one page website you've probably seen here: [jeissler.com](http://jeissler.com). I purposefully built this in static HTML5/CSS3 because it's a simple one pager not needing much else. Main goals where to redo the layout using flexboxgrid and flex alignments, CSSNext/PostCSS and explore webpack w/ custom build scripts. Uses the [ScrollMagicJS](https://github.com/janpaepke/ScrollMagic) library as well.
