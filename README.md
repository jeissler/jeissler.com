This is the home for my personal site built using Nuxt and Vue 3's composition-api, generated statically using a github action. Primarily I wanted this site to be hosted on a gh-pages branch so SSG was a good option; using Nuxt/Vue I was able to keep operability of routing and theme management across features consistent.
